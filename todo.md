### ideas
- Keep track of Supposed Version, Version from file, and file hash
- Suggestion of independent mods to check if they are needed (for lib mods)
- Add Web UI, either via electron or as a seperate website with websockets
- Add check for duplicate mod ids across files
- Make annotated mod json file location configurable
- Make mods folder location configurable

## doing
- Add a "last-changed" attribute, shouldn't trigger on disable
- Automatic update checker for github releases, curseforge, modrinth (needs version tracking)
- Keep track of how likely update is to happen for a given mod (from when last update was)
