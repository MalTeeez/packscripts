### ideas
- Suggestion of independent mods to check if they are needed (for lib mods)
- Add check for duplicate mod ids across files
- Automatic update checker for curseforge & modrinth
- Add functionality to just provide download url, to append a new mod to map (download to temp, extract id, move to mods/)
- Add ability to revert latest update
