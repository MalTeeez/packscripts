### ideas
- Populate some entries (i.e. version, source, dependencies) from the mcmod.info
- Keep track of Supposed Version, Version from file, and file hash
- Keep track of how likely update is to happen
- Add mode to singulary disable / enable just one mod (and its deps)
- Suggestion of independent mods to check if they are needed (for lib mods)
- Automatic update checker for github releases, curseforge, modrinth (needs version tracking)
- Add Web UI, either via electron or as a seperate website with websockets
